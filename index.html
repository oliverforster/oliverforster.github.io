				<h1>Oliver Forster</h1>
				<p>I have recently made the change from cheffing into web development as I have always had an interest in technology. I made this choice as I felt web development is a better environment to work as part of a team to build great things.</p>

							<h3>8 Brit Racer</h3>
							<p>Is a two player racing game based on the 1983 arcade game called Track and Field. It was my first project at GA and was built using JQuery, HTML and CSS. Although not particularly complicated as my first major project it taught me a lot about how to manage my time effectively as well as some more advanced JQuery. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/oliverforster/WDI_Project1">View on GitHub</a></p>

							<h3>CookStarter</h3>
							<p>Is an app built using Sinatra in which chefs can log in and post recipes based on a weekly challenge. Then regular users can view all the recipes and vote on their favourites. I used PostgreSQL for the database and I used Pure css framework on the front end. The biggest challenge of this project was having two different types of users which made the database relationships much more complicated. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/oliverforster/project2">View on GitHub</a></p>

							<h3>GreenHub</h3>
							<p>Is an app we built for our group project using Express, Node.js and Mongodb. It is a community driven website which allows users to create or attend green energy projects in their area. This project was my first time building a website as part of a team and I felt it was a great learning experience. And gave me a chance to see how others went about solving problems. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fhhopkinson/WDI_project_3/tree/dev">View on GitHub</a></p>

							<h3>SofaKing</h3>
							<p>Was my final project built using a full MEAN stack. Mongo, Express, Node and Angular. It is a website where a user can suggest films or tv programs they like and then they are returned a list of recommended media, then the user enters their postcode and a list of open take away restaurants are listed. This was the first time I had used external APIâ€™s and was a great learning experience. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/oliverforster/project4">View on GitHub</a></p>
